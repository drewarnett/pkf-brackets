PKF Brackets for FRC Robotics

During the 2015 season, I was part of the mentor team for FRC 5474, the
Clairemonsters.  Both the team and I were rookies.  Fortunately, Paul
Koniarski, a veteran mentor, shared years of experience.

One year, Paul's team used had 80/20 material.  Great stuff!  But, the robot
ended up being heavy.  As a result, Paul came up with the idea of the these
brackets.  Paul says that this makes frame building almost as easy as building
with tinkertoys.

The idea of the PKF bracket system is to use 1 inch square 1/16 wall thickness
aluminum tubing joined with the brackets described here with 1/4-20 machine
screws.  Alternatively, when design is done, some or all of the 1/4-20 screws
can be replaced with 1/4 inch pop rivets.

Paul suggests making a rectangular frame base to mount on top of the drivetrain
to ruggedize it and to provide a base for building the rest of the robot
structure upon.

Construction consists of cutting tubing with a chop saw, drilling holes in the
tubing, and finally fastening the tubing with brackets and screws or pop
rivets.  This is almost as easy as 80/20, but can result in a lighter weight
structure.  (Compare the cross section of 80/20 material to the square tubing.)
A fun and smart design might consider use a blend of both 80/20 and PKF
brackets.

The brackets themselves are made from 1/4 inch aluminum and has 0.26 inch holes
to pass the fasteners.  We had a machine shop knock out brackets for us from a
couple of sheets.

The aluminum tubing in 6063 alloy was $19.20 (before student discount) per 16
foot piece from a local metal supply shop during the 2015 build season.

[TODO:  dig up and add my notes on cost of 1/4 inch plate and the cost per
bracket from the 2015 season.]

[TODO:  add sketches or photos showing application of the brackets.]
